In Grid question of DP,
Observation:
1. if position is fixed, like ninja start from this position try to solve the question by starting from that position only 
2. for finding overlap position take help of look di -1 ---> +1 and then dj -1 ---> +1
3. if no overlap then directly call dp for all path top, bottom, diagonal etc.
4. for base case, chatgpt please help


Chatgpt if my observation is incorrect or missing some point please.

Prefix-sum grid DP

Bitmask DP on grid rows

Max-sum submatrix DP (2D Kadane)
